# Assignments

All assignments will be listed here, along with due dates, and any required documentation. The four larger projects will also be listed here, but you will also receive a dedicated repo for those assignments.

### Week 1 - Due Monday, January 29th
Reading:
* Creative AI: [https://medium.com/@creativeai/creativeai-9d4b2346faf3](https://medium.com/@creativeai/creativeai-9d4b2346faf3) (please post response)<br/>
* (Recommended) What is AI & History: [Chapter 1 - Introduction - Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mperkows/CLASS_479/2017_ZZ_00/02__GOOD_Russel=Norvig=Artificial%20Intelligence%20A%20Modern%20Approach%20(3rd%20Edition).pdf)

Exercise:
* Get an input using more than two features (at least 3) into Wekinator working. Use the examples found in the [Wekinator Examples repo](https://github.com/artintelclass/wekinator_examples) to get started. You might find some other interesting OSC inputs [here](https://github.com/artintelclass/ml4a-ofx/tree/master/osc-modules). Using your inputs, train several classifiers in Wekinator. For example, if you're using a Face Tracker, maybe one class is mouth open, maybe another class is mouth closed, etc. After training, use your input running through Wekinator, sending out OSC to an output (like Processing). Make different things happen with each of your classes. (please post link to video of it working)

### Week 2 - Due Monday, February 5th
* **Post** one response that includes thoughts/reactions to both the reading and the game:
  * **Read** AI Revolution Part [1](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html)
  * **Play** [Paperclips](http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/) Go as far (or not) as you want with it.
* **Bring** an input to train for regression to class on Monday. This could be a Kinect, a Wiimote, your phone, a knob/sensor (Arduino), a computer vision algorithm (you'll want to do something more than just sending a raw camera feed, like use optical flow/blob detection/point tracking/etc). When choosing an input, keep in mind that for regression we want some sort of continuous input.
* **Interactive Project Prep**: Start thinking about an idea for your interactive project. This is the first project in our 4 major projects during the semester. 
  * Come up with some project call that you have been awarded. Perhaps you got awarded the job of coming up with a system that allows people to use gestures in their home to activate/deactivate various appliances/lights/etc. Or perhaps you got awarded the job to create a system that tracks and understands museum vistor movements in a space and triggers various sounds, visuals, and/or something else in an interactive installation. Or perhaps you were awarded a project tasked with building an interface for a new musical instrument, or maybe a game project, or.... (fill in the blank). This project could take many forms, but needs to include realtime machine learning trained with one or more sensors, and some sort of output. Be as detailed as possible about the project call, what is the setting, what the input should be, what the output should be, etc. Don't start thinking about the tech first, think about the thing you want to create first. After that, then think about what tools are needed for building the project. 
  * Be prepared to **present** your plans/project call on Monday.
  
* ***Post regression video before class Wednesday, February 7th***

### Week 10 - Due Monday, April 9
Exercise:
* Create at least 5 [deepdream](https://github.com/mtyka/deepdream_highres) images and 5 [style transfer](https://github.com/cysmith/neural-style-tf) images
* Post a link to the images on the Responses page

Read & Post a response:
* [A Return to Machine Learning - Kyle McDonald](https://medium.com/@kcimc/a-return-to-machine-learning-2de3728558eb)

### Week 11 - Due Monday, April 16
Exercise:
* Using several different Magenta music RNNs create a short (minimum 8 measures) piece of music. Stack drum loops, melodies, improvisations, chords, etc. to create the piece.

Final Project Start:
* Brainstorm ideas and concepts for your [final project](https://github.com/artintelclass/Final)
