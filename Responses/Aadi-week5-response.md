The article talks about some of the challenges with creating artifical intelligence that can make ethical decisions. I found it interesting that the 'black-box' algorithms that have become popular in recent years, such as neural nets, would actually be undesirable in most cases. While we did see some examples of how data could influence these artificial intelligence programs, such as with the twitter bot made by microsoft, they did not have as large an impact on real people. Even if the twitter bot started acting in a strange manner, its actual influence is limited. However, with robots, the repercussions for such scenarios could be catastrophic. One example would be in a war, where the actions of the machine could directly influence whether a person lives or dies. In such scenarios, it could be more beneficial to have a robot that always works as expected, rather than one that could act in an unexpected manner, even if it works correctly 99% of the time.

Chapter response:
This chapter was a bit difficult to follow. Part of the reason is because of how abstract some of the ideas discussed are. However, another issue is that some terms are not clearly defined for the reader. When talking about design, for example, the authors mention subjects from a variety of different fields, such as engineering and finance. The term design in these fields are applied towards very different things - for example, designing a product or designing a financial plan. Based on this, it would appear that design can be applied to anything discussing a desirable future, and the steps necessary to achieve that future. This is aligned with what the authors wrote. However, they also used the word design when talking about how the concept of design was integrated into capitalism over time. They discuss how design was 'hyper-commercialized' so that alternative forms of design were difficult to imagine. Making such a claim with the broad definition we had earlier, however, becomes difficult. For example, under this definition lawmakers could also be considered designers. Thus, either more clarification would be required on what they meant by hyper-commercialized, or what they mean by the term design.
