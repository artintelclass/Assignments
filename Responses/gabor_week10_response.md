For my capstone project I had to jump onto the machine learning train, but I had to realize it is moving incredibly quickly. I realized while one can spend all the time dwelling over math formulas, but what really makes a difference is knowing what is possible with machine elarning. Of course the math part will always be useful knowledge, while the applications of machine learning become outdated very quickly as Kyle McDonald proves. What makes machine learning so special isnâ€™t the math, but the opportunities it is opening in the way we create and the tools we can create using it. If I ever have the chance to learn machine learning more in depth, I would like to still concentrate on its applciations and step leading to its successful applciation in specific domains.
