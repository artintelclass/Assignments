Compared to arts work, current designs, specially industrial designs still concentrates on the utilities for current world, which actually restrains the potentials of creating more speculative designs. Speculative designs, are usually presented as projects in arts museums under the category of arts, but these seemingly trivial designs today might become very significant in the future, and Artificial Intelligence itself is a great example. After being created 30 years, the word eventually becomes an important technology field attracting people’s concern. Although AI applications today are almost ANI where human gives AI certain instruction, and AI conduct according the instruction, people starts concerning about ethics of AI’s conduct. Particularly, how to prevent AI from being used as automatic inhuman weapons and how it deal with moral dilemmas are two typical issues. From “Three Laws of Robotics” decades ago, to Tim O’Reilly’s questioning “what is the moral standard of AI”, moral standard still troubles people. Currently, a plausible idea is to set several doctrines as rules, and let AI to process a serial of conditional decision making. Personally, I agree with the idea, but such a programming ethics is merely an imitation of human’s inference and decision making with ignoring human’s hesitation activity.
