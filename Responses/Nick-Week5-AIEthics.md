## Week 5 Response - Nick

In response to the [ethics of AI](https://www.nature.com/news/machine-ethics-the-robot-s-dilemma-1.17881), it is important to note that these are conversations that are still argued by humans today. For example, the train dilemma question in philosophy:

![Photo of man decided which path to have the train take (Named train dilemma)](http://medina-psicologia.ugr.es/~cienciacognitiva/files/2015-17-f1.jpg)

This photo represents the dilemma posed in questions of philosophy: which path would you have the train take? As the question differs from putting family members on one side etc. the question gets harder for humans to answer. In turn, the question remains for things like autonomous cars (stated in the reading).
If the car is presented with the situation of killing a pedestrian or the driver - which would it choose? In this sense, the engineer would have to code the answer to this problem. The bigger problem there is the debate of the actual "right" vs "wrong" answer between humans.
In the reading, it seems the car could freeze in this situation if not properly coding for a scenario. The writer said in an experiemtn, "In almost half of the trials, the A-robot [the one to save the "human" robot] went into a helpless dither and let both 'humans' perish."
In regards to ML, the robots could be given a test set to understand what to do in certain situations, and from there, they would "know" what to do the next time a dilemma arose. In my opinion, I feel I would trust AI more if they were coded with a set list of rules rather than have it learn and decide in a scenario what to do on its own. 

[Speculative Everything](http://readings.design/PDF/speculative-everything.pdf)

I enjoyed the shooting down of predicting the future in this reading. The book discussed thinking of all possible "futures" that way we can see what we would like to have happen or not have happen in our reality. The fact of the matter is, we must discuss what future is "preferable", as different people/areas of work will have different preferable futures. That is the important part of this speculative design -- designing different possible futures as a discuss/talking point for the future we all find preferable. At the end, the reading suggest we need "more pluralism in design, not of style but of ideology and values." Here, I think that the idea of design to dream of different futures is still around. The book says that today most dreams are now simply hopes, but I feel that sci-fi is very prevalent in today's time, and whether the ideas in these movies/shows/books are possible in the future or not does not matter. Its more a dicussion of possibilities of futures. Which are the dreams the writer is asking for, not just hopes of a better future.
