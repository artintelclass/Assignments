I really enjoyed the reading on designing ethical AI. Both the machines-learning and the rule bound systems seem promising to me. I agree with the author that a rule bound system is going to come across as more trustworthy for the public. People would like to be aware of how the AI is making decisions and if they know that it is following a clear rule bound pattern they would be more likely to trust it. They would be sure of its actions. 
By using the example of the trolley situation, the author did a good job of putting things in perspective.It gives us an idea of how difficult it might be to design an AI that can make a decision in these scenarios. 

The machine learning approach was equally important. Contrary to the rule bound system, here the AI would not be governed by a fixed set of rules. Instead, the AI will learn from its experience. It will improve itself along the way to become better at what it is supposed to do. 

I agree with the author that in the end the best solution would be to have a combination of the two systems. However, I feel that there should always be a rule bound system in the background that lays out some fundamental and core rules that should to be followed everytime. On top of this basic framework we can have machine learning that would build up on this backbone and enhance the capabilities of the AI. This way we can be sure that even if the AI learns something wrong from the environment it is not going to violate the basic principles.
