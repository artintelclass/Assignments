Ethics has been a topic of bewilderment among human beings. We tend to differ at what is ethical and what is not ethical at different kind of decision we have to take in our life. Therefore, it is should be no suprise that machines will face the same problem as they start to make decisions. As mentioned in the reading, it is difficult to implement ethical rules becasuse ethical rules are not binary. When a human makes a ethical decision we tend to be okay with the decision because we do not consider humans to make the perfect decisions. However, we expect the machines to be accurate and always make the right decision. I believe that teaching ethics to the AI will be one of the most difficult tasks in the realm of AI.
