Ethics has been a topic of bewilderment among human beings. We tend to differ at what is ethical and what is not ethical at different kind of decision we have to take in our life. Therefore, it is should be no suprise that machines will face the same problem as they start to make decisions. As mentioned in the reading, it is difficult to implement ethical rules becasuse ethical rules are not binary. When a human makes a ethical decision we tend to be okay with the decision because we do not consider humans to make the perfect decisions. However, we expect the machines to be accurate and always make the right decision. I believe that teaching ethics to the AI will be one of the most difficult tasks in the realm of AI.

The reading on the speculative design was different and refreshing one. Majority of the time when we work on a design, we tend to look at the problems and work towards solving that problem. This tends to narrow our mind and make us unable to think outside the box. It is easy to look at a design and try to come up with a solution for that design. However, speculative design encourages us to think not only outside the box but out of our reality. Having no constraints could really bring about design that could change everything as we know it. It enables us to reimagine future and how we relate to the reality. It helps us to not only to create things but also to create ideas.
