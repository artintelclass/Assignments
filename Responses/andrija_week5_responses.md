[**1. Machine Ethics**](https://www.nature.com/news/machine-ethics-the-robot-s-dilemma-1.17881)

Ethical dilemmas in artificial intelligence / automated computer systems are fascinating since they not only reveal shortcomings and flaws in these systems, but also illuminate some human-focused crises. On the computer/AI end of things, the issue of choosing between two “bad decisions” highlights the problem of how a computer can make decisions that aren’t quantifiable. What I’m thinking about is, for example, making the choice between which of two people to let die. Although we, as a removed human observer, could follow this “logical” route of deducing what is the correct decision to make, we base this on certain human presumptions i.e. better to save a child than an older person, or better to save a “good” person than bad. We have both “logics” that are human-centered and those that would be difficult for a machine to compute i.e. what makes someone more “good.” Ultimately, the fact that this is such a huge issue and difficulty in regards to potential AI systems demonstrates that it’s no small issue for humans themselves. 

[**2. Speculative Everything: Chapter 1 - Beyond Radical Design?**](http://readings.design/PDF/speculative-everything.pdf)

Although it seems obvious after reading this chapter, I never really realized how response-focused design could be thought to be; that it is rooted in looking at issues in the present and attempting to resolve those issues. This alternative view—speculative design—opens up a different possibility. Rather than designing to solve existing issues, through this approach we imagine a future, the designs that constitute that future, and then through a dialogue of future and present, we can potentially understand more about our current situations and trajectories. 

Speculative design seems to bridge more clearly the gap between design and art, at least in my mind. In a way, speculative design seems to relinquish its immediate “usefulness,” or an immediate practical application. But that’s why it seems closer to art to me, since it creates a space for reflection on the difference between a projected future and the real present.  It seems far more discursive than functional.
