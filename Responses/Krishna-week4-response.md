As computers are getting more and more powerful we are transferring many of our decision making process to the computers. At times, computers are asked to make decision that could have huge repercussions. Computers make decisions based on the information they get and for computers it is always black or white (1 or 0). However, the decisions we make in our day to day life are not black and white. Ethics and morality are not black and white. Trying to use computers to determine what is moral and ethical may not give us the answers we want. 

Moreover, computers use maths and statistics to make decisions. It simply uses the rule that the majority is right. However, we know that majority is not necessarily right. As mentioned in the readings , it is indeed one of the most difficult problem we will face and to some extent already facing as we tend to transfer our decision making process to computers or machines.
