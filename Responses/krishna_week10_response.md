There is a lot of fear and hysteria about the future of machine learning and AI. Many people fear that it might not only replace manual and repetitive jobs but also creative jobs. Style transfer being able to transfer style of one image to another can be considered as a machine doing creative job. However, Kyle McDonald believes that a creative work done by the machines will be different than the ones done by human. They will augment our creativeness rather than replace us. Creative AI will help us create art that we will not be able to create otherwise and experience art in completely unique way. Similar to Kyle, I also believe that we should be excited to explore AIâ€™s creativeness rather than be afraid of it. Art that can be created with AI will help us go places where we have not been before.
