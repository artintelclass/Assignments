It is very exciting and fascinating to see the amont of progress that is happening on the machine learning front. Not only the amount of applications out there, but also the variety in the nature of projects that are present in terms of the data that is being used to train and the outputs as well. I also found Kyle's work strategy to be really interesting. The way he learns about something new, explores it through small studies and then and then integrating his own artwork to give it a more personalized touch represents alot of intellectual curiosity. One of the most interesting aspects of the article was the discussion on autoencoders. The idea of creating a bottleneck and learning to contruct the input is a very interesting one. Unsupervised learning will mean that the learning will no longer be restricted by labels created by us which creates a whole new level of outputs that can be produced. It also seems like at this moment in time we are restricted by the limited computational power present, which means that the technology combined with increase computational power in the future will only lead to faster advancement in the field.
