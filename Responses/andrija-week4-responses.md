**1. Is AI Sexist?**

I think the Microsoft Twitter-bot fiasco is a good example to learn from when thinking about how Artificial intelligence systems behave within the context of their current level of development. Although the project was essentially “misused” by internet users, I don’t think the result is too different from other examples of AI systems that are trained on “neutral” data and come out with biased outputs. What this demonstrates to me is that AI systems, since they very much do not possess logic and consciousness at the moment, are going to put out what we out in to them.  

I also think its interesting, but more than that alarming, to think how easily AI systems can be used to reinforce heteronormative and anti-feminist sentiment by willingly or unwillingly embedding it in the technology we use, since we assume that the tech we use is neutral. I think this is rarely the case, and the way we design and build AI systems, as well as any technology is not a matter to be taking lightly.  


**2. AI Programs Exhibit Racial and Gender Biases**

This second reading echoed many of the same issues raised in the first, but also brought up an interesting alternative perspective, that the first didn't really consider. While by no means undermining the danger of embedding and legitmizing bias and prejudice within technology like AI, this writer suggests that AI could work in another way - to illumniate and cofirm those biases, and bring them to light, in a way that they can no longer hide behind masked intentions. Yes, AI may legitimize biases, but that could be a useful tool for taking steps towards dismantling those biases and prejudices - the revelatory potential of AI!
