The Guardian article about AI exhibiting racial and gender bias highlights something that is both good and bad. The bad is very obvious: AI has inherited the biases bias of its creators, us. The reason for this is almost as obvious; the data set that is used to train AI is all created by humans. So, if google news says "Black man shoots 35 people and then commits suicide" when a black person committs crime and remains silent about race when a white person does the same, AI would associate the word "shooting" and "suicide" with blacks. The good part is the fact that we have diagnosed this. This means that we can remove these biases explicity, something that is extremely important given that AI is slowly taking over all our tasks and might one day be making key decisions.

Reading the Bloomberg article right after has given me hope knowing that the best brains are working in the best labs around the world since 2011 to eliminate the human biases in AI. This work is imperative because, as the article mentioned, "[decisions made by AI could have] critical consequences to someone's life, health or financial stability". Before reading this article, I thought not much had been done, but thankfully I was wrong.
