Is artificial intelligence inherited racist or sexist? The answer might vary from different people, but we cannot neglect the truth that artificial intelligence just like the children of digital information contributed by the human being in the world. From my opinion, the learning path of artificial intelligence reflects the history of human culture, and without specific algorithm blocking the improper content, artificial intelligence is not able to distinguish the biased content and stereotype, and regard them the same as normal knowledge to process machine learning. As a result, if historical data include too many biased data, the big data will make artificial intelligence mistakenly regards it as the mainstream. Comparing to discrimination related issues where people generally disagree, some AI applications involved in people’s perception with potential possibility leading AI to prejudge people becomes more controversial. Take the “beautiful women” picture recognition as the example, there is not fault for AI who classifies the properties of these women, concluding with their similarity, but it is disrespectful for women without these properties. In short, AI just like a kid, and human are responsible to lead it to distinguish and try to prevent stereotype hurt it and people suffered from the stereotype.
