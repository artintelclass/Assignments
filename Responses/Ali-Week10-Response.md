# Week 10

## Reading Response

Kyle's article is a very enlightening read. It is interesting, and somewhat intuitive, to know that art and artists played a great role in the spread of machine learning. As the world progressed and scientists continued to go deeper in understanding CNNs and RNNs, art helped laymen understand the workings of the phenomenon that seemed too complex. Those who couldn't understand the intricate mathematical formulas and logic behind the neural networks were able to absorb some of the intricacies by looking at deep dream images. There is an inherent pattern that, although has its own complexity, is very easy to spot. And since humans have always been attracted to patterns and sequences, it is no surprise that Machine Learning and art caught on the way it did.
