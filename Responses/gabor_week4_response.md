“The blind application of machine learning runs the risk of amplifying biases present in data.” The number one task of modern data analytic tools and machine learning is to recognize meaningful patterns in data. We spent thousands of hours trying to make sure our algorithms can differentiate with 100% accuracy cats and dogs, but in the process we also created machines that recognize patterns in data that are not meant to be there.

Every machine learning tutorial starts with making sure your training data has an even distribution with no biases. However, based on recent readings, data that describes humans will likely also capture our biased nature. We thought algorithms are pure rationality, but as we increasingly take heuristic methods and train algorithms on human data, they seem to become the victims of human biases. As the paper “Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker?” points out even news corpora curated by professional journalists is characterized by our everyday gender bias. It is important to notice, because if we train a natural language processing model based on that dataset, we will end up with an undesired, gendered computer model of our language. Such a model is Word2Vec, which transforms words into vector in order to describe their similarities and to help natural language processing. Google trained a Word2Vec model on a biased news corpus, which has been widely applied in hundreds of production software and projects. Such software only amplifies the existing biases in our society.
