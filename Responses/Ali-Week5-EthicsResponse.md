## 1. Machine Ethics: The Robot's Dilemma

This article helps understand one of the most challenging components of making autonomous devices and machines. Questions such as the train dilemma help understand the problem that while some things are easy to code in robots, there are many situations when a decision is based on morals. Since us, humans, are indecisive and think differently about morals, it makes it even harder to design a robot to take moral decisions. The author mentions two approaches to it: 
1. Coding a set of rules in the robot
2. Having the robot make changes in its code as it learns

Though it would be extremely hard, I would want to go with an approach where we combine both of these approaches. 
After reading this article, I have begin to realize how complicated it is to make robots and decision-making devices specially those that can endanger human lives such as drones in a war or self-driving cars.

## 2. Speculative Everything Ch. 1

Speculative design was a very welcome change from the other readings. Having read several problems related to robots in the previous readings, I had started to think of autonomous devices under certain rules and restrictions. After this reading, I have come back again to thinking of designs that might not be useful right now but that may cater to needs of the future. The future, which different people think will be different, helps us think of designs that might not seem plausible today.
