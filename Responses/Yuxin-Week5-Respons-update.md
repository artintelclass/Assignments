1.Compared to arts work, current designs, especially industrial designs still concentrates on the utilities for current world, which actually restrains the potentials of creating more speculative designs. Speculative designs, are usually presented as projects in arts museums under the category of arts, but these seemingly trivial designs today might become very significant in the future, and Artificial Intelligence itself is a great example. After being created 30 years, the word eventually becomes an important technology field attracting people’s concern. And now, starting from current perspective, where ANI is speeded in many fields with ample applications, people are supposed to look forward and forecast what will be the next step of AI’s development. From my perspective, I do not agree some scientists regarding AGI as the next step that will come very soon, but what shall we concern is how people integrate different ANI and create an inter-connected ANI system.

2.Although AI applications today are almost ANI where human gives AI certain instruction, and AI conduct according the instruction, people starts concerning about ethics of AI’s conduct. Particularly, how to prevent AI from being used as automatic inhuman weapons and how it deals with moral dilemmas are two typical issues. From “Three Laws of Robotics” decades ago, to Tim O’Reilly’s questioning, “what is the moral standard of AI”, moral standard still troubles people. Currently, a plausible idea is to set several doctrines as rules, and let AI to process a serial of conditional decision-making. Personally, I agree with the idea, but such a programming ethics is merely an imitation of human’s inference and decision making with ignoring human’s hesitation activity. Therefore, we shall re-consider whether it is good for us to use human’s rules to instruct AI. From cognitive science, an interesting human mental decision making is called null-decision, which reflected by word like “maybe next time”, indicating when the person would prefer not make the decision immediately, but has to make some decision, then he or she will choose this kind of answer to stall. Also, it is widely accepted that human being’s mood always influence their decision-making. Therefore, if we really want to make AI something like human, maybe it is a good idea to set these features on AI, such as allowing AI choose to do nothing when it encounter the trolley dilemma while it is just a passenger-by, or allowing historical data of each AI to influence its future decision under the same condition.
