What is AI & History: [Chapter 1 - Introduction - Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mperkows/CLASS_479/2017_ZZ_00/02__GOOD_Russel=Norvig=Artificial%20Intelligence%20A%20Modern%20Approach%20(3rd%20Edition).pdf)

You can write your responses right here in this README, create another markdown document, provide a link to a blog, or however you wish, as long as I can access them from this repo.

---- Response ----

One of the main points that struck me about this article was the discussion of whether we are empowering ourselves with technology or slowly replacing ourselves. The article responds by saying augmentation is, "raising the collective human potential, not replacing it." This section struck me because I have had this debate in classrooms, with friends, and with family. It was an interesting take to say that you shouldnt think of it as a replacement completely, but a replacement for us to go and have the potential to rise above the jobs we have given to machines. 

I also found the part about Generative Design stimulating. The discussion of documentation has a pretty strong basis in today's age with all the collaborative and free to use software online today. For example, anyone can go onto GitHub, clone a repo, and continue working on someone else's project. In this sense, documentation is very important to let other users know what has been done and even how to set everything up. In the article, Michael Hansmeyer says Generative Design is more about, "thinking about designing not the object but a process to generate objects". In this description, I first think about documentation and how you should write it to explain your process to others. On the other hand, I never thought of this as a description about teaching AI to create pieces. Exactly how Mr. Hansmeyer describes this process is how I think about what we are going to do in this class. We are trying to teach our computers to use a process and from that process generate works.
