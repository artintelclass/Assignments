In this article, Kyle shows various applications of Artificial Intelligence, from relative simple classification to hard unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The progress of applications also reflects the process how people gradually get more comprehensive and deeper understanding of artificial intelligence. Interestingly, this progress also shows how arts and technology get closer. Taking the project Deep-dream for example, when I read a blog about these wired pictures, it was the first time I noticed there was a thing called AI, and it was intelligent enough to choose different area of an image to generate exotic picture. Compared to scientific terms about convolutional neural networks, the visual impression from Deep-dream is more straightforward and closer to the public, and arts hereby plays a role in connecting people and modern technology by interpreting the function in a widely accepted way.  At the same time, the artists involved in introducing the modern technology in this way are required to understand the essence of technology, leading some of professional artists unable to cross the threshold, while the technology experts have the chance to enter arts field. The emerging of arts and AI enable more people to use it, and therefore accelerate the process of AI as a positively motivated loop.
