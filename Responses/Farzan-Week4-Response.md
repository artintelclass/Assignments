The first article on exhibition of racial biases is quite an interesting one but shouldn’t come as a surprise because it is based on the logic of machine learning, i.e the ability to train a machine on provided data. The strength of machine learning is being able to get a machine to behave in a way that suits us and this is done using training so it is perhaps not a surprise that it is exhibiting the same racial biases that we exhibit. It is an alarming prospect, however, that AI might further reinforce these biases because of its inability to restrain. This ability can be implemented if we carefully filter the data that it is trained on.

It was a positive experience reading the second article because it highlighted the efforts that are being put into eliminating biases from artificial intelligence. The article reiterated the point raised in the first reading that biases in artificial intelligence reflect the biases present in the data we train it on. It was very interesting to read about the rectification measures that are being taken to rid of this problem especially the point about finding problems that you don’t even know about. The difficulty of finding such problems is amplified by the fact that some machine learning systems are black box systems so it is hard to figure out what the process is, which makes it harder to rectify the problems.
