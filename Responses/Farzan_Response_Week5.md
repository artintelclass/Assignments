Ethics pose a difficult area of development when it comes to autonomous systems. Quite often some of the applications that are discussed for these autonomous systems rely heavily on the judgement of a human being in control of those situations. The first article made me relate to some research I did on autonomous systems and ethics and what came to mind was the debate of using autonomous systems for military applications. While the use of autonomous vehicles provides a lot of pros, it also cannot parallel the judgement and instinct of a pilot in that scenario. This can be related to the hypothetical scenario used in the article regarding the pulling of the lever to re-direct a train. It will always be a challenge to have a specific answer to these situations because even humans donâ€™t agree with some of them.

The second reading offered a refreshing change of pace in terms of the ideas it talked about. The idea of letting ideas flow freely seemed like the author was perhaps putting forward the idea of having a disconnect from reality. It made me think of the prompt for the first assignment, which had an instruction on thinking of an idea first instead of thinking of tech. When we think of tech, we put ourselves in a box before we even start thinking about an application. I think this is what the author was trying to say when he talks about thinking of alternatives instead of thinking of ways to deal with emergency situations like the the shortage of something.
