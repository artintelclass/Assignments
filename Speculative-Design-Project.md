# Horizon by Alejandra & Andrija

For our speculative design project, Alejandra and I have taken a plunge into looking at what form online consumption could manifest in the future. We thought about current models of online shopping services, the role that advertisements play, and what kind of relationship is established between the consumer and the sellers. 

For our project we have invented a fictional online “shopping service” called Horizon. The name was chosen based on a brief survey of the characteristics of some existing services’ names—many based around the idea or reference to a market, or an explicit reference to exchange (souk, market, bay etc.). So we have Horizon, a service that promises to revolutionize a user’s online shopping experience. So we drop the reference to exchange in our name, and instead prompt the user towards the broad yet undefined potential that 'Horizon' engenders.

Our idea with Horizon was to identify critical elements in contemporary online shopping—the hyper-saturation of advertisements experienced by users, and the seemingly limitless choice faced by shoppers. Horizon attempts to offer solutions by eradicating these problems completely, and in doing so, really alters the relationship between consumer and supplier. 

Horizon eliminates ads and choices completely. The user faces no advertisements and product suggestions, but the user also doesn’t really have any choice in what they purchase. Horizon selects the products that the user needs based on a complex (and potentially biased) calculation that incorporates financial, biological, and demographic data from the user. 

We believe that current models of online-shopping are based on the idea of tailoring products to what a set of algorithms have determined a user to be. The ads you see, the products that are suggested to you, and the things you ultimately buy have been carefully filtered and delivered to you based on an assessment of “you.” With Horizon, we turn the idea on its head. Rather than tailoring products to fit a person, Horizon tailors the user to a set of standards through the products it gives them. Horizon draws user in with the promise of a “small” monthly subscription with which they can receive a variety of products—products whose value potentially far exceeds whatever the user pays each month. The drawback is that the user relinquishes any control of what they receive, and so this project speculates what can happen when a consumer gives up control of what they consume.  

We take a slightly dystopian perspective, in regards to the corporation behind Horizon having, what could at best be described as, ambivalent intentions. The testimonies provided in our pamphlet show that the result of Horizon’s product distribution is widespread homogenization. This is mild result. Our initial brainstorms looked at how the corportation could deliver specific products in order to enforce and shape class, gender, and social power structures to give a few examples. 

Our output for the project is a pamphlet for Horizon, which introduces the service to new users, provides information for how to register and enroll, and then some customer testimonies. 

Our idea was to use the format of a corporate-positivist type informational brochure, steeped with vague positive language, about bettering oneself etc. What we thought was interesting is that this kind of language, which we scoff at today as unbelievable and inefficient, actually reflects the way lives are changing in this future where Horizon is a reality (as shown through the testimonies). 

In the pamphlet we wanted to demonstrate how much of a user’s information is relinquished to Horizon, in terms of financial information and bio-data specifically. It was important for us to also show a future where people are quite willing to give this away for the promise of more “things.” It’s interesting to contrast this with present situations where it isn’t quite clear what we are receiving in exchange for the information we give away, and Horizon serves as a kind of hyperbolization of this. We give so much away though it’s not very clear what we receive in return.

# Eve by Ali & Yuxin

For our speculative project, we were inspired by the video where a MIT team tried to detect people's heart rate to speculate their mood, and we decided to speculate the future security system using a technology similar to vein matching. Based on a very intelligent AI algorithm, this system will protect people and prevent crime, but as a dystopian project, we will also present the disadvantage of the super powerful AI when it is hacked and used to control everyone.

In detail, our speculation is based on a system composed of two components. The first component is a chip that is inside every living person. It is connected to the second component, a superintelligent survilliance computer. The planted micro electronic chip scans people’s veins and transmits their heart rate, blood pressure, breath frequency and hormone levels through Wifi to a super artificial intelligent. This AI analyzes data to detect mood changes and predict behavior. Once it detects anything unusual, the AI system will alert the nearest hospital or police station, depending on the situation.

With years of data from every individual, the AI is so well trained by analyzing each individual’s data comprehensively that it knows the behavioral and health patterns of every individual. Comparing the real-time data and individual historical data, it is able to easily predict the future of every individual. This means that it can detect epidemics and viruses, and alert the health authorities on time to implement health safety measures. Moreover, since it knows the behavioral pattern of every individual, it can alert the police when it predicts that a person with criminal record is up to something bad.

In our project, we show that the survilliance can even be used to control people. 

Overall, our speculation is based on the promising development of currently existing technologies, and the major argument focus is that with ample training data collected for decades, a super AI is able to infer people's mood and even the action based on their vital signs. Under this super surveillance, people have no way to hide their mood, and their actions can also be forecasted by the AI. What if the AI is not only a super inspector but a powerful judger? In our project, the super AI is designed to be able to control people's mind and action by injecting hormone into people's body to amplify or change their mood. With the data it collected and learned, it may even know how to induce people to have certain action by switching its hormone level. At the age of such a super surveillance, more private fields is exposed to technology.
