# Horizon by Alejandra & Andrija

For our speculative design project, Alejandra and I have taken a plunge into looking at what form online consumption could manifest in the future. We thought about current models of online shopping services, the role that advertisements play, and what kind of relationship is established between the consumer and the sellers. 

For our project we have invented a fictional online “shopping service” called Horizon. The name was chosen based on a brief survey of the characteristics of some existing services’ names—many based around the idea or reference to a market, or an explicit reference to exchange (souk, market, bay etc.). So we have Horizon, a service that promises to revolutionize a user’s online shopping experience. So we drop the reference to exchange in our name, and instead prompt the user towards the broad yet undefined potential that 'Horizon' engenders.

Our idea with Horizon was to identify critical elements in contemporary online shopping—the hyper-saturation of advertisements experienced by users, and the seemingly limitless choice faced by shoppers. Horizon attempts to offer solutions by eradicating these problems completely, and in doing so, really alters the relationship between consumer and supplier. 

Horizon eliminates ads and choices completely. The user faces no advertisements and product suggestions, but the user also doesn’t really have any choice in what they purchase. Horizon selects the products that the user needs based on a complex (and potentially biased) calculation that incorporates financial, biological, and demographic data from the user. 

We believe that current models of online-shopping are based on the idea of tailoring products to what a set of algorithms have determined a user to be. The ads you see, the products that are suggested to you, and the things you ultimately buy have been carefully filtered and delivered to you based on an assessment of “you.” With Horizon, we turn the idea on its head. Rather than tailoring products to fit a person, Horizon tailors the user to a set of standards through the products it gives them. Horizon draws user in with the promise of a “small” monthly subscription with which they can receive a variety of products—products whose value potentially far exceeds whatever the user pays each month. The drawback is that the user relinquishes any control of what they receive, and so this project speculates what can happen when a consumer gives up control of what they consume.  

We take a slightly dystopian perspective, in regards to the corporation behind Horizon having, what could at best be described as, ambivalent intentions. The testimonies provided in our pamphlet show that the result of Horizon’s product distribution is widespread homogenization. This is mild result. Our initial brainstorms looked at how the corportation could deliver specific products in order to enforce and shape class, gender, and social power structures to give a few examples. 

Our output for the project is a pamphlet for Horizon, which introduces the service to new users, provides information for how to register and enroll, and then some customer testimonies. 

Our idea was to use the format of a corporate-positivist type informational brochure, steeped with vague positive language, about bettering oneself etc. What we thought was interesting is that this kind of language, which we scoff at today as unbelievable and inefficient, actually reflects the way lives are changing in this future where Horizon is a reality (as shown through the testimonies). 

In the pamphlet we wanted to demonstrate how much of a user’s information is relinquished to Horizon, in terms of financial information and bio-data specifically. It was important for us to also show a future where people are quite willing to give this away for the promise of more “things.” It’s interesting to contrast this with present situations where it isn’t quite clear what we are receiving in exchange for the information we give away, and Horizon serves as a kind of hyperbolization of this. We give so much away though it’s not very clear what we receive in return.

# Eve by Ali & Yuxin

#### [Project Video: Eve](https://youtu.be/u_3r484y00Q)

For our speculative project, we were inspired by the video where an MIT team tried to detect people's heart rate to speculate their mood, and we decided to speculate the future security system using a technology similar to vein matching. Based on a very intelligent AI algorithm, this system will protect people and prevent crime. But, as a dystopian side to it, we will also present the disadvantage of the super powerful AI when it is hacked and used to control everyone.

In detail, our speculation is based on a system composed of two components. The first component is a chip that is inside every living person. It is connected to the second component, a superintelligent survilliance computer. The planted micro electronic chip scans people’s veins and transmits their heart rate, blood pressure, breath frequency and hormone levels through Wifi to a super artificial intelligent. This AI analyzes data to detect mood changes and predict behavior. Once it detects anything unusual, the AI system will alert the nearest hospital or police station, depending on the situation.

With years of data from every individual, the AI is so well trained by analyzing each individual’s data comprehensively that it knows the behavioral and health patterns of every individual. Comparing the real-time data and individual historical data, it is able to easily predict the future of every individual. This means that it can detect epidemics and viruses, and alert the health authorities on time to implement health safety measures. Moreover, since it knows the behavioral pattern of every individual, it can alert the police when it predicts that a person with criminal record is up to something bad.

Overall, our speculation is based on the promising development of currently existing technologies, and the major focus is that with ample training data collected for decades, a super AI is able to infer people's mood and even the action based on their vital signs. Under this super surveillance, people have no way to hide their mood, and their actions can also be forecasted by the AI. At the age of such a super surveillance, nothing would remain private.

# Compainy by Gabor and Nick

[Introducing Compainy](https://vimeo.com/261075607)

In a world where AI automation is everywhere, one man introduces an idea to have humans take back control of running businesses. Kovacs Sanyi introduces Compainy; with Compainy you have the power to create a startup from the ground up, with the help of AI automation. Does using AI automation to start a business mean you have control, or is this just another attempt to let humans believe they still have power over machines?


# Movie Maker by Farzan and Manas

### Idea
It is a common thing to hear dissatisfaction over a finished cinematic product these days whether it’s the ending of a 10 season TV series or a highly anticipated movie. The dissatisfaction makes sense as fans tend to invest themselves in these cinematic products but are sometimes left disappointed in a way that can’t be changed. Moreover, owing to the increasing saturation and commercialization of concepts means that fans are sometimes left craving for something that is either defying the current ‘normal’ or something more catered to their immediate viewing needs. 
This means that there is a need for something that has the ability to produce content according based on the viewing needs of the user, so we propose the application, Movie Maker. Movie Maker, will be based on the essential idea that every scene is created of moving pixels, which can be generated by an intelligent system that is trained on a wealth of movie footage. Concentrating on three parameters for the beta version of our app: genre, setting and time period, we kept training the system on footage while changing the parameters accordingly. After training, the system can produce scenes that are based on parameters set by the user. 

### Process
We started our process with some brainstorming over the different ways in which our idea could be brought to life. We started by coming up with an idea for a user interface and what it would look like if someone was using our product in real life. The first thing that came to our mind was making a web app because only if our product lived on the web would it become easily accessible to everyone with an internet connection. So we started by thinking of the different parameters that we would give our uses to choose from while using the app. For the beta version of our app, we decided to include three parameters: genre, setting and time period. Based on these three and the choices made, the user would get a movie.  
For our training data, we have different videos that our model was trained on. We recorded videos and collected stock footage that we thought would be a good representation of what a model should be trained on to make a basic scene. In our demo, we are mainly showing stock footage because we think that looks more professional. 
At this point, we are only creating silent films. Once we are given more funding, we will be able to venture into films which have audio as well. To do this we will also have to train our model on audio samples from a variety of places. That will be the next step of development and will require more time. 
Other steps in our process included making the presentation pitch because we are in a way pitching our idea to investors. Editing our videos on iMovie was also a part of this process. 


### iChip by Krishna Gaire and Aadi Joshi

The year is 2040. Artificial intelligence and biotechnology have improved at a tremendous rate. The company Tangerine has released the iChip, a human embedded processor that can partly control what we see and hear. The iChip has the following capabilities:

-It can create an overlay of information on top of what we see
-It can record everything we see and hear
-It can extract relevant information from the internet

By using these three capabilities, it is possible for the iChip to offer a new feature, the ‘auto-conversation’. This feature uses the information that it recorded, as well as relevant information that it found online, to overlay the user’s vision with suggestions for what to say next during a conversation. This has allowed the user to carry out an entire conversation while paying attention to something else, like a video. However, as this technology improved and became more widespread, entire conversations were being carried out between iChips, which has lessened actual human interactions.

It also caught the attention of major newspapers. You can find the coverage by CNN and Time magazine below.
