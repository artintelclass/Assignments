# Horizon by Alejandra & Andrija

For our speculative design project, Alejandra and I have taken a plunge into looking at what form online consumption could manifest in the future. We thought about current models of online shopping services, the role that advertisements play, and what kind of relationship is established between the consumer and the sellers. 

For our project we have invented a fictional online “shopping service” called Horizon. The name was chosen based on a brief survey of the characteristics of some existing services’ names—nature, the idea of the organic or natural is invoked, as well as the suggestion of great potential. So we have Horizon, a service that promises to revolutionize a user’s online shopping experience. 

Our idea with Horizon was to identify critical elements in contemporary online shopping—the hyper-saturation of advertisements experienced by users, and the seemingly limitless choice faced by shoppers. Horizon attempts to offer solutions by eradicating these problems completely, and in doing so, really alters the relationship between consumer and supplier. 

Horizon eliminates ads and choices completely. The user faces no advertisements and product suggestions, but the user also doesn’t really have any choice in what they purchase. Horizon selects the products that the user needs based on a complex (and potentially biased) calculation that incorporates financial, biological, and demographic data from the user. 

We believe that current models of online-shopping are based on the idea of tailoring products to what a set of algorithms have determined a user to be. The ads you see, the products that are suggested to you, and the things you ultimately buy have been carefully filtered and delivered to you based on a assessment of “you.” With Horizon, we turn the idea on its head. Rather than tailoring products to fit a person, Horizon tailors the user to a set of standards through the products it gives them. Horizon draws user in with the promise of a “small” monthly subscription with which they can receive a variety of products—products whose value potentially far exceeds whatever the user pays each month. The drawback is that the user relinquishes any control of what they receive, and so this project speculates what can happen when a consumer gives up control of what they consume.  

We take a slightly dystopian perspective, in regards to the corporation behind Horizon having, what could at best be described as, ambivalent intentions. The testimonies provided in our pamphlet show that the result of Horizon’s product distribution is widespread homogenization. This is mild result. Our initial brainstorms looked at how the corportation could deliver specific products in order to enforce and shape class, gender, and social power structures to give a few examples. 

Our output for the project is a pamphlet for Horizon, which introduces the service to new users, provides information for how to register and enroll, and then some customer testimonies. 

Our idea was to use the format of a corporate-positivist type informational brochure, steeped with vague positive language, about bettering oneself etc. What we thought was interesting is that this kind of language, which we scoff at today as unbelievable and inefficient, actually reflects the way lives are changing in this future where Horizon is a reality (as shown through the testimonies). 

In the pamphlet we wanted to demonstrate how much of a user’s information is relinquished to Horizon, in terms of financial information and bio-data specifically. It was important for us to also show a future where people are quite willing to give this away for the promise of more “things.” It’s interesting to contrast this with present situations where it isn’t quite clear what we are receiving in exchange for the information we give away, and Horizon serves as a kind of hyperbolization of this. We give so much away though it’s not very clear what we receive in return.

# No Way To Hide by Ali & Yuxin

For our speculative project, we were inspired by the video where a MIT team tried to detect people's heart rate to speculate their mood, and we decided to speculate the future security system of the UAE using vein matching. Based on a very intelligent AI algorithm, this system will protect people and prevent crime, but as a dystopian project, we will also present the disadvantage of the super powerful AI when it can know everyone and control everyone by injecting the hormone.

In detail, our speculation is based on a system containing vein matching, planted devices, widely spread Wifi portal to transmit data to central super intelligence AI. Vein matching, also known as vascular technology, is a technique of biometric identification through the analysis of the patterns of blood vessels visible from the surface of the skin. This is done through infrared light which is absorbed by the Haemoglobin in a subject's blood vessels and recorded (as dark patterns) by a camera. 

In current technology, vein matching is one of the most accurate recognition method which works much better than facial recognition. However, current technology level does not allow the vein matching widely applied. In our project, we speculate the planted devices have already applied, and a tiny camera can be attached as part of a planted micro electronic chip that will scan people’s veins and transmit their vein pattern along with their heart rate, blood pressure, breath frequency and hormone levels through Wifi to a super artificial intelligent. This AI will identify the person by comparing the results of vein pattern to its database and analyze the other data to detect abnormalities. Once it detects anything unusual, the AI system will alert the nearest hospital or police station, depending on the situation.

With years of data from every individual, the AI is so well trained by analyzing each individual’s data comprehensively that it knows the behavioral and health patterns of every individual. Comparing the real-time data and individual historical data, it is able to easily predict the future of every individual. This means that it can detect epidemics and viruses, and alert the health authorities on time to implement health safety measures. Moreover, since it knows the behavioral pattern of every individual, it can alert the police when it predicts that a person with criminal record is up to something bad.
